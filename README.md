# MedSync ü©∫

MedSync is a **decentralized healthcare data management system** designed to revolutionize consent management, data access tracking, and incentive mechanisms in healthcare. By leveraging **Starknet** and **Calimero**, MedSync ensures scalability, security, and privacy while maintaining seamless interoperability between private and public blockchain contexts.

## Features ‚ú®

### **1. Consent Management**
- **Add Consent:** Patients specify entities and purposes for which their data can be accessed, with fine-grained control.
- **Verify Consent:** Entities verify valid consent dynamically before accessing patient data.
- **Revoke Consent:** Patients can revoke data-sharing permissions at any time.

### **2. Data Access Logging**
- **Log Data Requests:** Track when and by whom patient data is accessed to maintain transparency.
- **Fetch Data Logs:** Retrieve historical data access logs for audits or patient review.

### **3. Reward Pool**
- **Reward Distribution:** Incentivize entities for ethical and compliant data usage with a reward pool mechanism.
- **Balance Tracking:** Monitor accumulated rewards for each participating entity.
- **Withdraw Rewards:** Securely redeem rewards as an incentive for active participation.

## App Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### **Overview**
MedSync follows a **hybrid blockchain architecture** by integrating the public blockchain scalability and security of **Starknet** with the privacy-focused, permissioned blockchain environment provided by **Calimero** nodes. This architecture ensures:
- Secure, scalable operations on Starknet.
- Private and controlled data processing on Calimero.

### **Why Use Starknet?**  

Starknet is a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum, leveraging **zk-STARKs** for zero-knowledge cryptographic proof systems. Here's how it benefits MedSync:
1. **Scalability:** Processes large volumes of transactions (e.g., consent additions, log updates) with low gas costs, ensuring MedSync remains efficient as it scales.
2. **Security:** Starknet's zk-STARKs ensure that all transactions are verifiable, tamper-proof, and secured on the Ethereum mainnet.
3. **Immutable Audit Trails:** Event-driven architecture ensures that all interactions, such as consent modifications and reward distributions, are recorded immutably on-chain.
4. **Cost Efficiency:** Starknet reduces gas costs while providing Ethereum-grade security, making MedSync sustainable even with frequent updates.

### **Why Use Calimero Nodes?**

Calimero provides a **secure, private execution layer** for sensitive healthcare data operations:
1. **Context-Aware Privacy:** Calimero nodes enable processing sensitive patient data off-chain without exposing it to the public blockchain. Only proof of actions, such as consent verification or reward distribution, is sent to Starknet.
2. **Interoperability:** Seamlessly integrates with Starknet, bridging private and public blockchain contexts. This ensures that private data remains protected while benefiting from Starknet's scalability and security.
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** With controlled access to private data on Calimero, MedSync can easily adhere to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
4. **Trusted Nodes:** Operates within a permissioned network, ensuring only verified entities can process sensitive data.

## Why MedSync? üåü

MedSync's architecture provides the best of both worlds:
- **Scalable & Cost-Effective:** Handle high transaction volumes with minimal costs on Starknet.
- **Private & Secure:** Protect sensitive healthcare data using Calimero nodes.
- **Transparent & Trustworthy:** Immutable audit trails ensure complete trust in the system.
- **Incentive-Driven:** Reward mechanisms encourage ethical participation in data usage.

With MedSync, healthcare organizations can ensure **patient empowerment, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency** in a decentralized, privacy-first ecosystem. üöÄ
